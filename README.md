# Things-to-not-do-during-PhD

Every human makes mistakes, as it is said “To err is human”. But it’s actually great to be aware of the possible mistake that could be made. Being aware can save you from making that mistake if not it can help you reduce its major effects on your life. So, in both cases, it’s a win-win situation for you. The mistakes that a researcher can commit during his/her are discussed in this book. These mistakes are very common, but can affect a researcher in multiple ways. While doing PhD, the life of researcher gets divided in three aspects i.e. personal life, academic life and financial life. The beauty of Ph.D. is that, it teaches you to balance all of them simultaneously.
